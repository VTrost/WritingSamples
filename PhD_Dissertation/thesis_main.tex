%\prefacesection{COVID-19 Impact Statement}
%It is worth noting that the Covid-19 pandemic did have a negative impact on this project, primarily in the form of limiting collaboration opportunities. The ability to perform research was not impacted because the model work could be done anywhere with a computer and an internet connection but the ability to connect with other people was restricted. The lockdown and transition to working from home meant that over a year was spent without any face-to-face supervision meetings or the research group meetings that had been a weekly occurrence before the pandemic. This resulted in less input and suggestions from other researchers. On top of that, the supervisor for this project was hospitalized with Covid-19 at the beginning of the pandemic, further limiting the amount of input and suggestions available for a few months. The pandemic also meant that travelling for additional training or networking was not possible. Such trips could have been beneficial for solving problems with the model that could not be answered by people locally or easily without face-to-face interactions. The actual model work for this project was able to continue more or less uninterrupted during the pandemic but the project became an essentially solo independent project with little to no external input for around a year.

\beforeabstract

	Antarctica has a unique environment and changes within the Antarctic atmosphere can have global impacts. The relative lack of aerosols in the Antarctic atmosphere mean that cloud processes will behave differently than those in more polluted regions and so models and parameterizations based on observations in the tropics and mid-latitudes will likely have poor success in simulating Antarctic clouds. This project set out to use the Met Office NERC Cloud (MONC) model and the Cloud AeroSol Interactions Microphysics (CASIM) scheme to simulate mixed-phase clouds observed in Antarctica during the Microphysics of Antarctic Clouds (MAC) field campaign. The main focus of the project was to test the theory that secondary ice production was the cause of the patchy ice distribution that was observed. A secondary focus was to test the ability of ice nucleation parameterizations to accurately simulate Antarctic clouds and evaluate potential first ice sources. Most of the project was devoted to learning how MONC and CASIM function and this thesis provides details on the structure and means of configuring the models. The challenges of learning how to use the model without detailed guidance meant that an accurate simulation of the MAC clouds was not possible. An example of the outputs that the model was able to produce are discussed but the main focus of the thesis is on the structure of the models and guidance of how to begin configuring the models for a range of mixed-phase cloud studies. Recommendations about how to make the models more accessible to new users are also discussed.

\prefacesection{Acknowledgements}
	I would like to thank my supervisors, Thomas Choularton and Paul Connolly, for their guidance and support over the last four years. Thank you to Hazel Jones, Emma Simpson, Adrian Hill, and everyone in the MONC user Slack group who were available for asking questions about the models I was using. Thank you to Sebastian O'Shea for providing the observation data used in this project and to everyone in the Centre for Atmospheric Science who provided suggestions and support. Finally a big thank you to my friends and family who supported me, kept me sane, and helped me make the most of my time in Manchester.
